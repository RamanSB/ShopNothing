# ShopNothing
A market place for users to purchase nothing. Full Stack MERN project.

Please note the products you are not actually purchasing any products in this project, nothing will be delivered. This is just a sample project that demonstrates a few concepts; stripe-api (checkout session), JWT & other MERN stack features...

## Improvements
1) Use a silent refresh token (a second long-lived token that is stored in cookie, this is used to generate an access-token (short-lived token))
2) Check if User is signed in (by checking JWT) rather than using react state.
